# React useEffect Hook with Missing or Incorrect Dependencies

This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications: the misuse of the `useEffect` hook's dependency array.  Incorrectly specifying dependencies can lead to unexpected behavior, performance issues, and difficult-to-debug bugs.

## The Problem

The provided `bug.js` file contains a `MyComponent` that utilizes `useEffect` to log the current count. However, if the dependency array is missing or incorrect, the effect might not run as expected, leading to stale closures or unexpected re-renders. 

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected version.  By including `count` in the dependency array, we ensure that the effect runs only when the `count` variable changes.
